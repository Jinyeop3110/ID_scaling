       "[\"Biodegradability of the molluscicidal saponins of Phytolacca dodecandra.\\nThe biodegradability of water-extracted saponins of berries from the Endod plant, Phytolacca dodecandra L'Herit, was evaluated under OECD standardized conditions. Persistence of the saponins was evaluated by determination of saponin concentrations in water over a 30-day period, using a quantitative HPLC method and a semiquantitative hemolytic assay, which is considered a potential field method. The two methods were compared. Bioassays were simultaneously conducted using Biomphalaria glabrata fresh water snails to assess the molluscicidal potency over time. All experiments were carried out in water, which was chemically balanced to sustain snails, and to one set river water was added to the medium to mimic natural conditions. (1) Saponin concentrations in water treated with an aqueous extract of P. dodecandra cultivar E44 were stable for 2 days then rapidly decreased during the third and fourth day. Lethal concentrations to snails were LC50 = 9.6 mg/l (95% CI: 6.3 to 19.4) in one set and LC50 = 6.8 mg/l (95% CI: 5.4 to 12.2) in the other. Adding river water to one set of the experiments had no effect on the mean saponin concentration over time (F = 0.02, P = >0.05). (2) Comparison of the hemolytic assay with the HPLC method showed no significant difference in mean saponin concentrations (t = 0.32, P > 0.05, 95% CI: -2.67 to 3.64), and a correlation of r2 = 0.88 between the two methods. (3) The saponin fraction of an aqueous extract of P. dodecandra was readily biodegraded (t1/2 = 15.8 h), and the complete consumption within a 10-day window indicates ready degradability in aquatic environments under aerobic conditions. (4) These results show that the use of Endod berries for snail control in schistosomiasis-infested water bodies is environmentally acceptable.\",\n",

       " 'Cocaine Health Risk\\n\\nA cocaine user may abuse this drug many times and escape serious physical problems - he thinks. What he may not realize is that cocaine always creates severe stresses on the heart, arteries and veins. The heart beats faster, arteries and veins constrict and blood pressure increases. Every part of the cardiovascular system suffers damage from the increased strain.\\n\\nGradually, as more cocaine is used, the heart responds to this stress by thickening certain parts of the heart. A thickened heart is less flexible and pumps blood poorly. This thickened heart tissue can prevent the flow of blood to the heart muscle itself.\\n\\nCocaine Alone Can Kill\\n\\nCocaine abuse can be deadly all by itself. Most drug-related deaths result from the use of multiple drugs at one time, but cocaine kills more than its share of drug users all by itself.\\n\\nFor example, in the Atlanta area in 2010, 73% of all single-drug deaths resulted from cocaine. In Washington, D.C., nearly 60% of all single-drug deaths were caused by cocaine.\\n\\nCelebrity Deaths from Cocaine Alone\\n\\nWhile thousands of people around the world have died from heart-related problems resulting from cocaine abuse, when the individual is an entertainer or sports figure, then more is known about the conditions of their deaths. For example:\\n\\nTed Demm: Hollywood director who died of a heart attack while playing a celebrity basketball game. He was 38 years old. An autopsy showed thickened heart tissue resulting from cocaine abuse.\\n\\nJohn Entwistle: Bass guitarist for The Who until his death in 2002. Cause of death was determined to be a heart attack induced by cocaine abuse.\\n\\nBobby Hatfield: One of the Righteous Brothers. He died in 2003 with the autopsy report stating that an overdose of cocaine had triggered a heart attack.\\n\\nIke Turner: Musician, heavily addicted to cocaine for many years, at one time spending more than $56,000 a month on the drug. Died from a cocaine overdose.\\n\\nDavid Waymer: Defensive back for the San Francisco 49ers and Los Angeles Raiders. At the age of 34, died of a cocaine-induced heart attack.\\n\\nA person using cocaine should know the risks to his health from the abuse of this drug.\\n\\nNarconon and the Narconon logo are trademarks and service marks owned by the Association for Better Living and Education International and are used with its permission.\\n\\nNarconon Suncoast is a nonprofit, public benefit corporation licensed by Narconon International to use the Narconon trademarks and service marks to operate a Narconon drug rehabilitation and education program.',\n",
       " \"Q:\\n\\nConditional independence of random variables\\n\\nLet $(X_t),$ $(Y_t)$ be independent bounded martingales (for filtration $ \\\\{ \\\\mathcal{F}_t \\\\}$ )which converge to $X_\\\\infty$ and $Y_\\\\infty$ respectively, by the martingale convergence theorem. Let $\\\\{ \\\\mathcal{F}^{X,Y}_t \\\\}$ denote the filtration generated by processes $X$ and $Y$. Then the book claims that\\n\\n$$ \\\\mathbb{E} [X_\\\\infty Y_\\\\infty | \\\\mathcal{F}^{X,Y}_t ] = \\\\mathbb{E} [X_\\\\infty  | \\\\mathcal{F}^{X,Y}_t ] \\\\mathbb{E} [Y_\\\\infty  | \\\\mathcal{F}^{X,Y}_t ] = X_t Y_t \\\\quad  \\\\text{ a.s..}$$\\n\\nCan anyone explain to me why $ \\\\mathbb{E} [X_\\\\infty Y_\\\\infty | \\\\mathcal{F}^{X,Y}_t ] = \\\\mathbb{E} [X_\\\\infty  | \\\\mathcal{F}^{X,Y}_t ] \\\\mathbb{E} [Y_\\\\infty  | \\\\mathcal{F}^{X,Y}_t ] $ ? Does this conditional independence property follow from the independence of the stochastic processes $X$ and $Y$?\\n\\nA:\\n\\nThe answer is quite nontrivial and requires $X,Y$ to be continuous independent martingales. See \\nhttp://mech.math.msu.su/~cherny/pmt.pdf\\nwhere it is laid out in full detail. I will present an an easy version in which $X,Y$ are bounded.\\nTheorem: If $X,Y$ are continuous bounded $\\\\mathscr{F}_t$-martingales, then $XY$ is a continuous $\\\\mathscr{F}_t$- martingale.\\nProof: It suffices to show $\\\\langle X,Y\\\\rangle = 0$. Since $X,Y$ are continuous, $\\\\langle X,Y \\\\rangle_t$ is the limit in probability of sums like\\n$\\n\\\\sum (X_{t_{i+1}}-X_{t_i})(Y_{t_{i+1}}-Y_{t_i})\\n$\\nas the partition size $\\\\Delta$ tends to $0$. We'll show these sums converge in $L^2$ to $0$.\\n$$\\nE\\\\left(\\\\sum (X_{t_{i+1}}-X_{t_i})(Y_{t_{i+1}}-Y_{t_i})\\\\right)^2 =\\\\sum E(X_{t_{i+1}}-X_{t_i})^2E(Y_{t_{i+1}}-Y_{t_i})^2\\n$$\\n$$\\n\\\\leq \\\\max_i E(X_{t_i+1}^2-X_{t_i}^2) \\\\cdot \\\\sum E(Y_{t_{i+1}}^2-Y_{t_i}^2) =\\n\\\\max_i E(X_{t_i+1}^2-X_{t_i}^2) E(Y_t^2 - Y_0^2).\\n$$\\nThe max term tends to $0$ as $\\\\Delta\\\\to 0$ since $EX_t^2$ is continuous in $t$ (monotone/dominated convergence). Thus $\\\\langle X,Y\\\\rangle_t =0$.\\nIf you wanted to extend this to continuous local martingales (showing $XY$ is a local marginale), you would then take a reducing sequence of stopping times where the local martingales are bounded (hence true martingales) and approximate.\\nTo then extend to continuous martingales, stop the martingale at times which it is bounded and apply the result for local martingales. Then use standard estimates to get $L^1$ convergence and show $XY$ is a martingale.\\n\\n\"]"
